    <h2>Recusion</h2>

    <h1> What Is Recursion? </h1>
    <p> Recursion is a problem solving technique using the idea of "divide and conquer". Recursion occurs when a method calls itself until a certin condition is met. Every time the method is called, the problem you are trying to solve should be broken down into smaller parts. After dealing with each little part, a overall result should be achieved. Some benifits involved with using recursion is its clarity and simplicity as well as its display of the use of an algorithm. There are however some downsides. Recursion takes up a ton of space. Everytime the the method is called, its parameters and local variables muct be stored somewhere in memory. This process of storing and releasing memory also adds to the overall time needed for your recursion. Almost all recursive solutions can be written as an iterative solution, but when a non-linear data structure is needed, recursion is definitly a good choice. </p>

    <h1> Simple Recursion </h1>

    <h1> Mutual Recursion </h1>
    <p> Mutual Recursion occurs when one method calls a second method which calls the first one. You will usally see this type of recursion when working with 2-dimentional arrays and mazes.
