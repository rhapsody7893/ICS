    <h1>A Bit About Myself</h1>
    <p>My name is Michael Zhou and I am a 16 year old student who currently enrolled in the MaCS program at William Lyon Mackenzie CI.</p>
    <p>Some of my intrests include reading, badminton, and chess. My favourite subjects are Math and Science.</p>
    <h1>Personality - INTJ (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judgment) </h1>
    <p>My personality type is INTJ. I have a slight preference of of introversion over extraverion, a little to no preference of intuition over sensing, a moderate preference of thinking over Feeling, and a moderate preference of judging over perceiving. Some famous INTJs include John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, and Michelle Obama.
    Some characteristics associated with this personality type are decisiveness, reliability, open mindedness, perfectionism and logicalness. To people of this personality, anything can be possible and they can come to reason with anything. They prefer to reason and think instead of following their gut and their feelings. The power of thinking is a great aid and tool to these people. </p>
    <p>Most of time, people of this personality type find success in area that require creativity and a mastering of information. Successful people of this personality are usually found in areas that require research and development.  Some careers paths that suit my personality type include Engineering, Accounting, Dentist, and Law. However, this can vary based on the expressiveness of the personality scores. </p>
    <p>People of this personality type are conferrable carrying out conversations and can get straight to the point. However, in some cases, they can be closed and reserved in communication, especially when talking about poetry and arts. Their contacts are mostly limited to family, friends, and colleagues.  
    The learning style of my personality includes finding and reflecting on deep and clear answers to questions. People of this personality are also more interested in finding answers to fundamental questions and practical questions. Taking logical information through systematic teaching that includes visual aids is helpful, as well is independent work. They have relatively good memorization abilities and can organize and reproduce information. They have a high tolerance to stress but prefer to finish and learn material a good amount of time before the due date.</p>
    <p>I have many things in common with this personality type and I find it pretty accurate especially the learning style. I like to learn visually with the help of visual aids, and prefer independent work in quiet, closed spaces. However, I not very great at memorizing things and it takes me a while before I can reproduce the information. For example, when memorizing vocab for English/French, it takes me a few days to completely recite the words.</p>
    <p>The characteristics are pretty accurate as well. I’d like to think that I’m pretty reliable and responsible since I almost always hand in my things and get to school on time. I don’t talk that much but I can hold a conversation on topics that I am interested in. I prefer to learn about things such as math and science but I also take drawing and painting lessons. When working and solving problems, I do prefer to use facts and experience instead of feelings. In the case of being a perfectionist, I usually do want to get as high a mark as possible and spend time to obtain that mark but the thing that I think is the most important is being able to understand the concepts. Just like what my personality says, I do prefer to do my work a good amount of time before it is due, but I can still handle the stress of doing things last minute. However, unlike my tested personality I don’t think that I am very decisive. It takes me a good deal of time to make decision that I won’t regret.</p>
    <p>According to the test, most people of my personality type find interest and success in doing the things they “can” do and most of these people working in fields of engineering and sciences. In the future I would also like to work as some sort of engineer.</p>
    
    <h1> Achievements </h1>
    <p> I have been placed on the honor roll for many waterloo math contests such as Fryer, Galois, and Caley. </p>
